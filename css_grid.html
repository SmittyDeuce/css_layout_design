                <section>
                    <p>
                        The Saiyan race is the race of the main protagonists in the show, 
                        including Goku/Kakarot, Vegeta, and Broly, who are the only full-blooded 
                        Saiyans left alive. Gohan, Goten (sons of Goku), and Trunks (son of Vegeta) 
                        are half-human, while Pan (granddaughter of Goku) is 1/4 Saiyan. The Saiyans 
                        were originally a warrior race known for their incredible fighting abilities 
                        and battle-hardened nature. They were almost entirely wiped out by Frieza, 
                        a powerful tyrant, who feared the potential threat they posed. Bred for combat, 
                        Saiyans were known for being cold-hearted warriors who thrived on the thrill of 
                        battle and sought to increase their strength. They often conquered planets, 
                        selling them to the highest bidder, and those with higher battle power held higher 
                        social status within their society. Goku, raised on Earth, became an exception, developing 
                        a kind and compassionate nature that set him apart from the typical Saiyan demeanor all 
                        thanks to falling on his head as an infant.

                    <h2>Saiyan Transformations</h2> <!-- Subheading for the second section -->
                    <p>
                        Saiyans possess the unique ability to transform, drastically increasing their power levels.
                        The most well-known transformation is the Super Saiyan form, characterized by golden hair and
                        a significant power boost. Goku was the first Saiyan to achieve this form in centuries, during his
                        battle with Frieza.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other transformations include Super Saiyan 2, where the user's power and speed are further amplified,
                        and Super Saiyan 3, which features even more pronounced physical changes and a massive increase in power.
                        In the Dragon Ball Super series, new forms like Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue have been introduced,
                        pushing the limits of Saiyan power even further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each transformation is typically triggered by intense emotion or a need to surpass one's limits,
                        highlighting the Saiyan's warrior nature and their potential for growth.
